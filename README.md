# Cron Job Service with NestJS and MongoDB

This is a simple service built using **NestJS** and **MongoDB** to manage cron jobs. It allows you to create, update, delete, and retrieve cron jobs. It also provides a webhook to receive and store data in JSON format, and includes functionality to store history of cron job executions.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve cron jobs.
- **Cron Scheduling**: Supports scheduling cron jobs with weekly, monthly, etc., timings.
- **Webhook**: Accepts data from external services and stores it.
- **History Tracking**: Tracks the history of cron job triggers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to avoid abuse.
- **API Throttling**: Helps ensure service stability.

---

## **Technology Stack**

- **Backend**: NestJS (JavaScript)
- **Database**: MongoDB (No Mongoose, direct MongoDB driver)
- **Cron Scheduling**: Native JavaScript cron jobs (for simplicity)
- **API**: RESTful API with Express router in NestJS

---

## **Setup and Installation**

Follow the steps below to set up the service:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashraful2871/cron-job-with-nest-js.git
cd cron-job-with-nest-js
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Configure MongoDB**

You need to configure MongoDB to work with the service:

- Ensure you have a MongoDB database set up. You can use MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB instance.
- Modify the `MONGO_URI` in the `bootstrap.js` file:

```javascript
const MONGO_URI = 'your-mongodb-connection-string';
```

### **4. Start the Service**

To start the service, run:

```bash
nodemon src/main.js
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### **5. API Endpoints**

The service exposes the following endpoints:

- **POST /api/cron-jobs**: Create a new cron job.

  - Request body example:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Test Cron Job",
    "link": "https://example.com",
    "apiKey": "your-api-key",
    "schedule": "weekly",
    "startDate": "2025-02-10T10:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

- **GET /api/cron-jobs**: Retrieve all cron jobs.

### **6. Webhook Endpoint**

- **POST /api/webhook**: Receives and stores data in JSON format. The data is stored with a unique ID and creation date.

---

## **Testing**

To test the API:

1. **Postman**: You can test the API using Postman by sending requests to `http://localhost:3000/api/cron-jobs`:

- **POST** request to create a new cron job.
- **GET** request to retrieve all cron jobs.

---



## **Additional Notes**

- The service is designed for scalability and performance, using MongoDB to store cron jobs and their execution history.
- Rate limiting and API throttling are implemented to ensure stability and prevent abuse of the API.
- The webhook endpoint ensures that external services can send data and it will be saved for further processing.
